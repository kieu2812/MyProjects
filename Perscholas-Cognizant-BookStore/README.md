This is a commercial book store web application that allows customer to order books on-line. The application will support features for both customer (users) and administration. 

Basically, the application is implemented using: 
	Java 8
	Spring Frameworks 5 as Spring MVC, Spring Rest, Spring Security, Spring Transaction, Spring Validation 
	Hibernate
	JDBC and Connection pool  
	Oracle 12 
	Tomcat server 8
	Maven
	Eclipse and SQL Developer

The home page will display top best books. Customer access the website be able to search books by name; see what kinds of category book; review policy, order books, etc. 

Customer has to register an account before making an order. Registered password will be encoded using Spring Security Crypto BCrypt. The application will be using Spring Security to authenticate if an user existed. 
There is limit login time feature that user account will be locked if continuously failed login, for example 3 times. This is only feature that implemented by Hibernate.

Making an order will perform multiple operations such as create order, order detail, shipping detail and credit card info so they all are performed in one transaction using Spring Transaction.

As an administration role, you are be able to add new book, update book and delete book. You also able review customer orders and reports.

The input forms are validated using Spring Validation and DAOs/Services are tested by JUnit.
